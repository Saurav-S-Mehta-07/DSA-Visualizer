# Interactive Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) Visualizer

## Overview
This project is an **interactive DSA visualizer** designed to make learning data structures and algorithms intuitive and engaging for students. It allows users to **see algorithms in action** while also understanding their **steps, pseudocode, time complexity, and space complexity**.

## Features
- **Algorithm Visualizations:** Step-by-step animations for key algorithms.
- **Educational Insights:** Shows algorithm steps, pseudocode, time complexity (TC), and space complexity (SC).
- **Interactive Controls:** Users can modify inputs (e.g., array size, tree nodes) and observe changes in real-time.
- **Supported Data Structures & Algorithms:**
  - **Searching:** Linear Search, Binary Search
  - **Sorting:** Bubble Sort, Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, Counting Sort, Heap Sort
  - **Binary Tree Traversals:** Preorder, Inorder, Postorder, Level Order
  - **Graph Algorithms:** BFS, DFS, Dijkstra’s Algorithm, Prim’s Algorithm
