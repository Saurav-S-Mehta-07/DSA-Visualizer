# Data Structure & Algorithm Visualizer

A *Data Structure and Algorithm Visualizer* built during a Hackathon to help students understand complex algorithms through real-time animations and interactive visualizations.


#Overview
This project visualizes the internal working of *Data Structures and Algorithms* step-by-step.  
It helps users clearly understand how sorting, searching, tree traversal, and graph algorithms operate.
